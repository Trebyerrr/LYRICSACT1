<p>Ooh, ooh<br>
This is gonna hurt, but I blame myself first<br>
'Cause I ignored the truth<br>
Drunk off of that love, it my head up<br>
<p>There's no forgetting you<br>

<p>You've awoken me, but you're choking me<br>
I was so obsessed<br>
Gave you all of me<br>
And now, honestly, I got nothing left<br>

<p>I loved you dangerously<br>
More than the air that I breathe<br>
Knew we would crash at the speed that we were going<br>
Didn't care if the explosion ruined me (me, me)<br>
Baby, I loved you dangerously<br>
Mm, mm<br>
I loved you dangerously<br>

<p>Usually, I hold the power with both my hands tied behind my back<br>
Look at how things change<br>
'Cause now you're the train<br>
And I'm tied to the track<br>

<p>You've awoken me, but you're choking me<br>
I was so obsessed<br>
Gave you all of me<br>
And now, honestly, I got nothing left<br>

<p>Cause I loved you dangerously<br>
More than the air that I breathe<br>
Knew we would crash at the speed that we were going<br>
Didn't care if the explosion ruined me (me, me)<br>
Baby, I loved you dangerously<br>

<p>You took me down, down, down, down<br>
And kissed my lips with goodbye<br>
I see it now, now, now, now<br>
It was a matter of time<br>
You know I know<br>
There's only one place this could lead<br>
But you are the fire, I'm gasoline<br>

<p>I love you, I love you, I love you<br>
I loved you dangerously<br>
Ooh, more than the air that I breathe<br>
Oh, now, knew we would crash at the speed that we were going<br>
Didn't care if the explosion ruined me (me, me)<br>
Oh, oh, baby, I loved you dangerously<br>

<p>Mm, mm<br>
Ooh, I loved you dangerously<br>
Ooh-ooh, I loved you dangerously<br>
